# Welcome to my Advent of Code!

Advent of Code is an awesome coding puzzle challenge by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
Every year, in December, Eric and his team put out some funny Christmas-themed coding challenges.
There are public and private leaderboards, so you can challenge your friends and colleagues.

AoC's goal varies between coder and coder, personally it's an opportunity to learn a new language: this year (which is actually my first) I will focus on Golang.
